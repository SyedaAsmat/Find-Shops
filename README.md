# Find-Shops

This project works perfectly.
This project was made by using Python Django with Vue and Bootstrap

It can show various shops within the kilometer range of pincode.

To run install geopy packages and whatever necessary is mentioned at the time of execution.

It has an admin panel accessible to me only, using which I can modify the shops shown on the interface.

Note: Currently it as few pincodes as 226001, 226003, 226020, 226022, 226023.
